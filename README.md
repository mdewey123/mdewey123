## Hello there.
![](star-wars-hello-there.gif)

Graduating from Thompson Rivers University with a Bsc in Chemical Biology, I have an analytical mindset tailored to approach unique problems with novel solutions. In this degree I sought to solve medical and environmental issues through a chemical approach, designing de novo antimicrobial peptides and researching the affects of increased greenhouse gasses on the snowpack. Over the last year, I have been studying python fundementals and web design using Django framework. I am currently looking for entry level work to start my new career and a company I can grow to fit in, becoming a leading member of their team. No stranger to heavy workloads, I aim to always give it my all and constantly improve.
